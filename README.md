# Notivo – Web App (Landing Page + Dashboard)

**Notivo** is a modern web application that helps team leaders capture feedback, track achievements, and manage employee development — all in one place.

This repository includes the **custom-coded landing page**, and will later be extended with a responsive **dashboard UI** as part of a complete front-end build for portfolio purposes.
